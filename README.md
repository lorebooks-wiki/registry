# `registry.lorebooks.wiki`

[![octoDNS Deployments](https://github.com/lorebooks-wiki/registry/actions/workflows/dns.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lorebooks-wiki/registry/actions/workflows/dns.yml)

This repo holds our YAML-based DNS zonefiles for octoDNS, as well as public registry data, the
Community Lorebooks API and an issue tracker for subdomain requests (reservations, DNS records,
public abuse reports etc).

## What's available for use

Here are the domains we currently manage here for our subdomain service:

* `lorebooks.wiki` - @lorebooks-wiki's flagship domain for our subdomain service, primarly used for digital gardens
and wiki/documentation sites.
* `stellapent.wiki` - Maintained by @ajhalili2006, used for all things related to Stellapent Cier universe in Gildedguy Stories series,
although anyone in the Hyun's Dojo community can use it similarly to `lorebooks.wiki`.

If you do use (not only) Cloudflare as nameservers and/or want to team up with
us to help maintain the service (maybe have some spare domains to donate to us
or jointly maintain with us), email `contact@lorebooks.wiki` for a chat or
