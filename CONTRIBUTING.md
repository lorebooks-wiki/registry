# Contributing to the registry

Thanks for your interest in using Community Lorebooks subdomain service and/or
helping to maintain [the registry data](./data/).

## Components for beginners

Each component has its own documentation here in the registry monorepo and linked here for convenience:

* [DNS records zonefile](./dns/README.md) - the heart of this repository, used by [octoDNS](https://github.com/octodns/octodns)
* [Subdomain registry data](./data/) - manually-maintained YAML files for `lorebooks.wiki` and `stellapent.wiki` subdomains
* [Community Lorebooks API](./api/README.md) - the API for the registry data, among other things. ([api docs](https://api.lorebooks.wiki/docs))

## General contributing steps

1. Create your fork to easily publish your branches and send patches easily. (optional if you're going through the Git email flow).
2. Create a branch seperate from the main branch to keep things organized.
3. Start hacking around. :)
